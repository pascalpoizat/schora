SChorA
======

SchorA is a tool to analyze choreography specifications by using symbolics, based on  [Z3 SMT solver](http://rise4fun.com/z3), rather than using concrete data value. The mains features are: 
- Check the conformance of two models (one for specification and another for implementation) based on the branching bisimulation equivalence.
- Check the realizability of a choreography specification.
- Generate local specifications from a global one.
- Generate Symbolic Transition Graph of a model specification.
